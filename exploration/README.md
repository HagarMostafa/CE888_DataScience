# Unit 5: Storytelling

This week focuses on data exploration and storytelling. Open the notebook above (in colab or locally on your computer) and the quiz on Moodle and attempt the questions. In some of the cells I've already indicated to which question of the quiz the cell refers to, so you can do them together.

As usual, you will have to fill the quiz on Moodle to be marked for this assignment. You have until 1st April, 2022, 11:59am.
