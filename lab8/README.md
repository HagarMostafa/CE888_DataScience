# Lab 8 - RNNs for sequences

## Resources

* rnn.ipynb contains the code shown in the lecture 
* weather.csv contains the weather dataset used in the lecture


## Lab Exercises

- [ ] Create a folder called lab8
- [ ] Open rnn.ipynb in Colab and go through the code. 
- [ ] The exercise you have to do is at the bottom of the Notebook: can you create an RNN that has at least one Bidirectional layer and which obtains at least 90% accuracy on the validation set.
- [ ] Open the quiz on Moodle. You'll have to upload the model you created in the previous point and code a simple algorithm for the forward step of the SimpleRNN layer.
- [ ] After you've done it, make sure you save your version of the notebook (and your trained model) in your lab8 folder in Github!
